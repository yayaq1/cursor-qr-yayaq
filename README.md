# Cursor Credits QR Code Generator

Access the app at https://cursor-qr.vercel.app/

## Why This Exists

I needed to print QR codes for Cursor referral links to hand out at an event. Doing this manually would have been a hassle - generating each QR code individually, formatting them for printing, making sure they're properly sized and numbered.

Couldn't find a simple tool that did exactly what I needed, so I built this. It's a basic app, but it works well and maybe someone else will find it useful.

Upload a CSV file with your links (or paste them manually) and get a clean, printable PDF with 9 QR codes per page.

## What It Does

- Takes your Cursor referral links (or any links really)
- Generates QR codes for all of them
- Formats them in a nice 3×3 grid for printing
- Numbers everything so you can track which codes you've handed out
- Works with CSV upload or manual entry

## Cut-and-Stack Numbering

This app uses a special numbering system designed for easy physical organization after printing.

**How it works:**
- Instead of numbering 1–9 on page 1, 10–18 on page 2, etc.
- The same grid position across all pages gets consecutive numbers
- With *P* pages total, page 1 shows `#1`, `#1+P`, `#1+2P`, … in reading order across the 3×3 grid
- Example for 99 codes (11 pages): page 1 is `1, 12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89`; page 2 is `2, 13, 24, …`
- For 120 codes (14 pages): page 1 is `1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113`; the last page only fills slots whose numbers are ≤ 120

**After printing:**
1. Cut each page into 9 squares along the grid lines
2. Stack all squares from the same position together (all top-left squares, all top-middle squares, etc.)
3. Arrange the 9 stacks in the same 3×3 pattern as printed
4. Stack them left-to-right, top-to-bottom into one pile
5. Your QR codes are now in perfect order 1, 2, 3... with no sorting needed!


## How to Use

1. Choose to upload a CSV file or enter links manually
2. For CSV: Upload a file with one URL per row
3. For manual: Enter URLs one per line in the text box
4. Click generate to create QR codes
5. Print the results - they'll be formatted 9 per page
